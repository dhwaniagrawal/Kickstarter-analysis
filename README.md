# Kickstarting with Excel #

## Overview of Project ##

### Purpose ###

How did the campaigns in ‘Theater/Plays’ subcategory performed in relationship to the launch dates and funding goals. 
Louise’s play ‘Fever came close to its funding goals in a short span of time, Therefore she wanted to know about the other campaigns in the same category in terms of when they were launched and what was their funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges ##

### Analysis ###

Analysis is performed when you have concrete data and one can use it to draw a conclusion. In this project, we have used formulas to get the exact numerical values, pivot tables and pivot charts to display the required data, filtered data to view the desired results and finally, line graphs to compare the data.

### Challenges ###

* Selecting the right data required to get to the conclusion.
* Using the correct syntax in formulas
* Understanding the hierarchy of the data to draw the right conclusion.

## Results ##

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date ###

*  Success to fail ratio doubled in the months of May and June whereas in Dec it remained the same.

### Limitations ###

1. Too much data.- It contains data that is not required for the analysis making it look more complex.
2. Limited to only 13 countries.

### Recommendations ###

We could use pie-chart to show all three successful, failed, canceled data for a particular category. We can also use clustered combo chart to highlight the important data points and to understand the pattern/trend.
